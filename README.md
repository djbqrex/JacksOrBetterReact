# JacksOrBetterReact
The popular video poker game "Jacks Or Better" made into a simple react project. Uses the fantastic project found at https://github.com/deck-of-cards/deck-of-cards for the deck.

Sometimes simply called "Draw Poker," is the most common variation of video poker. Payoffs begin at a pair of jacks (pair of 10s or less are a non-scoring hand), increasing with the value of the poker hand a player can create; three-of-a-kind, full-house, etc.
